# API-N-Dex

- API-N-Dex.com

## Project Description

This will be a an app where it will be easier for people to find a list of free api's that can be used and input new ones to share with others. My goal is to have an index of API's and with a post MVP of making it more dymanic and easy to navigate on.   

## Wireframes

The wireframes below shows the homepage, list page and form page for API-N-Dex web app. On the homepage it had an welcome text to the app and has a nav bar with a button one where it directs the user to a list page and a button to directs to a form. The list page will have initial api's that I will import with my Airtable. The form page will have a form where people can intergrate free Api's that they find to help users of the app. The form page will have a button to submit and it will then direct them to the api list page.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

My strength is knowing the layout of how I want my app to function. A have set myself up to hit all the target elements that are being require for the project and gave myself enought time to work on my postMVP. I have organized myself to have references to where I can look back if I get stuck. 



### Weaknesses:

I am still not too comfrtable with React so it will be a bit hard to start, I think there are so much information that I will be reviewing more in order to be able to complete this project.


### Opportunities:

The opportunity here is now being very hands on with front ends react app and with that I can really understand the functions and elements that are used to get a full functioning app up and running. This time around I can style it better than my previous project. 


### Threats:

Threat will be time and styling. I am still not familiar with bootstrap and will take a chunck of time making sure something looks right. I have to remind myself that I will be working on the simple layout first and then I will be able to go back and add more functionality and styling.
